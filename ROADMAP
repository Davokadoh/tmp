CORE

 [ ] Queued, chunk-based calculations
 [ ] Chunks are prioritized based on local variability
 [ ] Progress bar shows total progress
 [ ] Chunks moved out of the viewport are discarded
 [ ] Chunks moved inside the viewport are added to the queue
 [ ] Chunks are calculated progressively with increasing granularity
 [ ] Event queue for linux compatibility

GRID

can only contain ((width / tilesize) + 1) * ((height / tilesize) + 1) tiles
 - preallocate tiles and use / ditch them as needed
   - how?
     - THREADPOOL BABY
 - partitioning scheme
   - 64px always
     - get scale of 1px
     - separate into chunks that size

 -> maybe just check what is "renderable" which i can tell since ive got the
 previous and new viewport then clear the tiles that are left unused, and
 generate the ones that have entered the screen

 -> i could keep them all in a list and populate a "local" array
 before performing my generation/render that way i can keep all of my tiles
 neatly in memory, and i just have to recreate the hashtable

foreach (tile in list)
{
	if (! tile is renderable)
	{
		clear tile;
		get new tile;
	}
	put tile in local array;
}
